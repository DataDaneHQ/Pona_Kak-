**Welcome to the Pona Kakā Data Analysis Repository**

This repository contains my data analysis for the Pona Kakā Initiative, a culturally relevant intervention aimed at managing arthritis within Māori communities. Conducted on behalf of the Waikare Community Development and Research Trust and funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand (HRCNZ), this project involved analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data to uncover insights into participants' experiences, health outcomes, and the overall impact of the program.
